        ```markdown
        # Jenkins Installation Steps
        ```

3. **Insert Installation Steps:**
    - Copy and paste the provided installation steps into the README.md file.

# Jenkins Installation Steps

1. **Installing Jenkins**
   - First, update the default Ubuntu packages lists for upgrades with the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     ```
   - Then, run the following command to install JDK 11:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
     ```
   - Now, we will install Jenkins itself. Issue the following four commands in sequence to initiate the installation from the Jenkins repository:
     ```bash
     sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
       https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
     echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
       https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install jenkins
     ```

2. **Starting Jenkins Service**
   - Once Jenkins is installed, start the Jenkins service with the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start jenkins.service
     ```
   - To confirm its status, use:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status jenkins
     ```

3. **Adjusting Firewall Settings**
   - With Jenkins installed, we need to adjust the firewall settings. By default, Jenkins will run on port 8080.
   - To ensure that port 8080 is accessible, configure the built-in Ubuntu firewall (ufw). Open the port and enable the firewall with the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 8080
     sudo ufw enable
     ```
   - Test whether the firewall is active using:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw status
     ```

4. **Setting Up Jenkins**
   - To set up Jenkins, type in the IP of your EC2 instance along with the port number in a web browser. The Jenkins setup wizard will open.
   - To check the initial password, use the cat command as indicated below:
     ```bash
     sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
     ```
   
   All Set! You can now start automating...
```
